Description:
  Generates a policy for a model with the given name.

  Example:
    rails generate canner:policy user

    This will create:
      app/policies/user_policy.rb
  
  Note: 
    If you have overridden fetch_roles, or created a base policy of your own you'll want to pass
    the parent option and specify your parent.

    rails generate canner:policy user --parent BasePolicy
